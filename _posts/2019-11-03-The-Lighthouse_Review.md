*The Lighthouse*, a psych thriller directed by Robert Eggers, starred Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe, definitely elevates the 2019 cinematic experience to a whole new level. This movie is not so much a thriller but a great showcasing how isolation can turn a normal man into something crazy.

First of all, the cinematography and editing of this movie is just unreal. Choosing to make this a black and white (a very bright kind) film not only brings in some fairly pleasant texture to the movie, but also creating some sort of mysterious atmosphere and surrealistic vibe. It’s a pure aesthetic enjoyment to even just look at some of the shoots. We can say that, the cinematography of this movie even makes the jump scares classy. The 1:1 screen ratio makes the audiences put more focus on the characters which makes a lot of sense for this movie. The lighting and editing are also phenomenal. The only issue I have with the technical aspects of this film is the score. It just feels a bit over the top.

Based on some folk anecdotes from the New England region, the story itself is nothing new. But I’m still amazed at how the director can still pull out some really hilarious and absurd sense of humor out of it. It just makes the whole movie so much fun to watch.

As for acting, the chemicals between Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe just blew my mind away. Who would have thought these two guys can be such a great duo?

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
