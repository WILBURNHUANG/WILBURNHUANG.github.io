Honestly, I want to keep a blog to record my thoughts and research progress for a while now. However, procrastination is the norm of my life, so, yeah, here I am finally. Big shout-out to [Github](https://github.com/) and [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWrcgHwSG8M). 

What's my motivation of keeping a blog? Honestly, I don't know. This might even be a bit overwhelming in my current stage. But you know what, who cares. I'm too tired of justifying everyhing I do. I want to keep a blog, and that's it.

Just so you know, I'm a master student now, second year. I had like 1000 fantasies before entering this graduate school.
